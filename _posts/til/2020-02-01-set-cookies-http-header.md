Today I learnt about the [`Set-Cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) header
in HTTP. As per the documentation:

> The Set-Cookie HTTP response header is used to send cookies from the server to the user agent, so the user agent can send them back to the server later.

I have found that this is a fantastic way to set a cookie when using server-rendered websites.
